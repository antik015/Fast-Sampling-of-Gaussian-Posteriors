# Fast-Sampling-of-Gaussian-Posteriors
We propose an exact algorithm for sampling from high dimensional Gaussian distributions with certain structure. These structures routinely come up in many areas of Bayesian Statistical Inference. The code to implement the algorithm is also available for public use.
